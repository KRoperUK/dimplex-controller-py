# Validate GitHub alert syntax in tracked Markdown.
#
# GitHub renders `> [!IMPORTANT]` as a coloured callout only when the marker is
# alone on its line inside a blockquote. Break either rule and nothing complains
# anywhere — the marker just renders as literal characters in an ordinary
# blockquote. The integration repo shipped its unofficial-project notice that way
# on the repository home page for months (dimplex-controller-hass#182), after a
# formatter joined the marker with the line below it. This check is
# formatter-independent, so a hand-typed mistake is caught too.
#
# Ported from dimplex-controller-hass/scripts/check-md-alerts.sh (#202).
#
# Usage: scripts/check-md-alerts.sh [file ...]
# With no arguments, checks every tracked *.md file.
